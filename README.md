## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) \* Used for version control.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) \* Used to store the code once pushed from Git.

### What I learned

This is the first project I've built using the React Framework. It was a steep learning curve to unterstand the layout of the JSX syntax "state" and the functionality of the controled elements. Although it was a small project I feel i learnt alot.

### Continued development

Continue learning React on Udemy. Moving onto a bigger project
